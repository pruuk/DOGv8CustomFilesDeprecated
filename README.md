# Welcome to Delusions of Grandeur!

This is a repository for the custom files that run on top of the Evennia
codebase. In order to run these files, you'll need to clone your own copy
of Evennia's codebase, and then merge the files from here into your custom
game folder. It's recommended that you not import the settings from this
repository. Evennia can be found at: https://github.com/evennia/evennia

Evennia's documentation is here:
https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki.

DOG can be reached by going to http://165.227.184.28:4001 (to reach the web
portal), or by using a MUD client to log in to 165.227.184.28:4000.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly via Github.
