Talents Module.

This module is modeled after the skills module for the Ainneve mud based upon
Evennia. I've borrowed heavily from the code and style at:
https://github.com/evennia/ainneve/blob/master/world/skills.py

This module contains the data and functions related to character & NPC Talents.

Please see:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YoCURidXUJab1nQy1L5_66MF5n8D1QwQlojroV4XuGw/edit
and:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATy_q5RCEiCPj043pZbpJKFWbaruv5Vb2iP8yKWGv1c/edit
for more information about the world of DOG and the plan for implementing the
first sets of mutations and talents.

Module Functions:
    - `apply_talents(char)`
        Initializes a character's db.talents attribute to support talent
        traits. In OA, all talents start matching their base trait before
        the player allocates a number of +1 and -1 counters.
    - `load_talent(talent)`
        Loads an instance of the talent class by name for display of
        talent name and description.
    - `validate_talents(char)`
        Validates a player's talent penalty and bonus token allocations.
        Because the requirements depend on the char's INT trait, it
        accepts the entire char as its argument.
